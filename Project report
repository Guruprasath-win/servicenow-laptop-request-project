Abstract

This project demonstrates the creation and automation of a Service Catalog Item in ServiceNow for requesting laptops within an organization.
The Laptop Request Catalog Item enables employees to raise hardware requests, automatically routes them for approval, and generates fulfillment tasks for the IT team.
This automation enhances transparency, speed, and consistency in laptop provisioning.

⸻

1. Introduction

Manual laptop request and approval processes are slow and error-prone.
Using ServiceNow IT Service Management, we can design a self-service catalog item that automates requests, approvals, and fulfillment.
This project focuses on implementing a Laptop Request Catalog Item using Flow Designer for end-to-end automation.

⸻

2. Objectives
	•	Design a ServiceNow catalog item for laptop requests.
	•	Configure automatic approval and fulfillment workflows.
	•	Enable real-time notifications for every stage.
	•	Provide visibility and faster response times.

⸻

3. Existing System

Traditional request methods rely on e-mail or spreadsheets:
	•	Approvals are delayed.
	•	Tracking is difficult.
	•	Hardware inventory lacks updates.

⸻

4. Proposed System

The proposed ServiceNow solution:
	•	Lets employees request laptops from the Service Catalog portal.
	•	Routes requests automatically to managers.
	•	Creates fulfillment tasks for the IT Hardware group.
	•	Sends notifications for every update.

Automation ensures consistency, efficiency, and auditability.
